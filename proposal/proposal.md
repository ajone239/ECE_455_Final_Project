# LED Light Sign

## Concept
I plan to do a final project for the "Final Presentation/Project".
The project I intend to do is an IoT LED light sign.
The goal of the project is to have an LED sign that will display messages on it.
My roommates are very keen to interrupt me while I'm working or studying.
This sign is intended to be a means of deterrent.
While I cherish my roommates, their distractions are not welcomed during school or work.

## Plan
The plan is to use a WiFi module along with a microcontroller to host a simple webpage.
The webpage will allow the entry of messages or the selection of presets.
A user's browser will send back a response.
The microcontroller will then parse the web request and display the string on the LED Matrix.
The display of the sign will be a matrix of LEDs.
Either battery or wall power might be used for this project.
That is to be determined.
